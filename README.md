# Sportify - K-Means Clustering
Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering - develop fitted marketing strategies to each segment

## Sportify - Customer Segmentation and Insights:
Project Overview: Welcome to **Sportify**, your go-to destination for premium sports products and gear. Our mission is to provide athletes and enthusiasts with the best selection of sports equipment, tailored to their diverse needs.

In this project, we leveraged three crucial datasets to gain deeper insights into our customer base and enhance our marketing strategies. The datasets include:

**Digital Interactions**: A comprehensive collection of customer interactions across multiple online platforms, including emails, social media engagement, and in-app activities.
**Sports Product Consumption**: Data reflecting spending patterns across various sports products and activities, offering a view into product preferences.
**Demographics**: Insights into customer characteristics such as age, city, education level, and dependents, allowing for a better understanding of customer personas.
By applying **clustering techniques** to these datasets, we identified key customer segments. This enables us to develop tailored marketing strategies and product offerings that resonate with the unique needs and preferences of each group.

**Project Goal**: As a team of data scientists, our goal is to uncover hidden patterns to drive **data-driven decisions**. By segmenting customers based on their behaviors and demographics, we aim to:

- Uncover valuable trends
- Identify new marketing opportunities
- Optimize product offerings for better alignment with customer preferences
- Enhance the overall customer experience

This project showcases the power of data analytics and machine learning in creating actionable insights to improve customer engagement and drive business success.
